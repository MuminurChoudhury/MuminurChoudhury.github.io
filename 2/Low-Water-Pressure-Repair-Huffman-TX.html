<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the 3 readily available methods. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes finishing Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leakages and rust within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier in between the within the pipe and the material streaming through it. This repair technique is more suitable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals. The technician, Kenny, was courteous, informative and professional! He asked me to take a look at the camera with him then described my options without attempting to oversell me! I would highly suggest the Clog Dawg for a when or annual inspection if you suspect that roots may be causing havoc in your drainage pipes.</p>
<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and relies on a great balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers end up being frustrating, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. Waters than contain other anions such as chloride or sulfate can not be remediated by boiling, and are stated to be "permanently" hard. The only useful treatment is to remove all the ions, usually by the technique explained below.</p>
