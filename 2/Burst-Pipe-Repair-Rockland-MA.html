The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on.
