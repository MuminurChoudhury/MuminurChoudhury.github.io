<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman believed the price she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently could have conserved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or decreased pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention test kits and repair parts are a must for the devoted do-it-yourselfer. Our backflow test kits are compatible with all decreased pressure concept, check valve, spill resistant, and pressure vacuum breaker type backflow preventers. All our kits are compact and portable, and include the required gauges, pipes, and adapter fittings. Note: The Preparation & Development Department can not launch a list of authorized backflow prevention assemblies, which is offered to USC members only. However, for details on noted approved backflow assemblies, contact Backflow Prevention at 602-534-2140.</p>
