<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Latta SC</h3>
<p>If your polybutylene pipes have actually failed, read your insurance policy completely. Make sure you know what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 property owners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance coverage agent and verify your protection. Once you have reviewed your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to verify that your understanding is right.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
