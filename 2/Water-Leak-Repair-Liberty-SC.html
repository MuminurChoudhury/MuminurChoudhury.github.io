<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to refine your plumbing abilities if you're fairly inexperienced. So conserve yourself some major problem by being truthful with yourself about where your experience level is. Most backflow preventers are developed to allow the elements to be eliminated for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary in many cases. Some parts such as relief valve bodies might need to be removed from the main body to facilitate a repair. Understanding the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>

Both are more labor-intensive than PVC and HDPE piping.
