<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
