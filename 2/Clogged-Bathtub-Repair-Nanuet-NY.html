Call 404-524-1825 for knowledgeable Atlanta, GA repiping services. Backflow takes place anytime water flows through a water pipe in the opposite direction that it's meant to.

<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly.
