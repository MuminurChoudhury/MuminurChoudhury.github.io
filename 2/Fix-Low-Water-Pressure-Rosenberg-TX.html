Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
