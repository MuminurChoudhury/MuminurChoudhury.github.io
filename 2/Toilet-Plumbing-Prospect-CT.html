Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently could have saved her a great deal of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>If you begin to see lower water pressure in your sink or shower, this might be an indication of rust and mineral build-up which will gradually start to obstruct the circulation of water through your pipes. For build-up to affect your water pressure like this, it suggests that it has actually been accumulating for many years so you need to look into getting a plumbing inspection right away to guarantee your pipes haven't triggered any considerable damage, and plan on changing your piping sometime quickly.</p>
