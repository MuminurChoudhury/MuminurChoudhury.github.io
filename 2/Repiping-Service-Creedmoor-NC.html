<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
