<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It may not be installed in any area where it might ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't permit the use of a PVB at all, so talk to your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it should be set up in a location where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
<p>For whole-house repiping, the option usually boils down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is resilient and less expensive than copper. PEX is easy to install, which suggests the cost of installation might be low also. There is some risk of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is uncommon. In basic, it's a cost-effective solution that will stand the test of time. We frequently suggest this product, though it will depend.</p>
