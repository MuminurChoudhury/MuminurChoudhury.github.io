<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a nearby warm water faucet until you hear the burner in the water heater spark. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Turn off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem.</p>
