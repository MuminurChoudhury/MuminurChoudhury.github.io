If this takes place just when your hot water is running, it might be because of a rusty hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house.</p>

Metal electrodes are immersed in the water and release positive zinc ions, which also release electrons that move through the wire to the cathode. When the zinc anode liquifies, this procedure eventually stops.

This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
