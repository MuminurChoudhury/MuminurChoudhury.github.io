<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
