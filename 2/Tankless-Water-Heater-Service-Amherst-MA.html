Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
