<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank.

The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
