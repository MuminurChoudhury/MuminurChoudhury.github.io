If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

A softener is comprised of different elements, each having their own distinct purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel normally constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly described. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most fundamental type has an electrical timer that charges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
