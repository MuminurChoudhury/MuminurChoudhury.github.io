<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
