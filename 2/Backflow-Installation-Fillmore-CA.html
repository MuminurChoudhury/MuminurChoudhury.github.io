<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>

This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully restored.</p>
