For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and solidify or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape.</p>
