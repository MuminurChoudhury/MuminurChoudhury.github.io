Seattle Public Utilities deals with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline when it concerns backflow preventer requirements.</p>
<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
