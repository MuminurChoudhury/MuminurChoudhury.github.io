<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4.

When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
