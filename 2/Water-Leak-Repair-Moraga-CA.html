Well, first let's ask you a various concern: How old is your home? If it was developed prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an outdated material that will begin to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently). And if the house was built prior to World War II, then it almost certainly needs replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently becomes corrosive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the green and blue discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are available. But they're harder to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
