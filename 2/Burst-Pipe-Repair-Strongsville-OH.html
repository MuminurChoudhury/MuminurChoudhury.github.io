Soft water likewise extends the lifetime of plumbing by reducing or removing scale build-up in fittings and pipes.

<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in numerous parts of the plumbing system, many frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation issues or even stop a component from flowing entirely.
