<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>As tough water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, free" sodium ions are launched into the water. Softer clothes without hard minerals trapped in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dull gray brought on by tough water. Please send our thanks to all included with testing, repairing, changing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has actually repaired the problem we were having.</p>
