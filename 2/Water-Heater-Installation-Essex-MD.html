<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any leftover pollutants.</p>
