<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly regrowed. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to decrease these signs.</p>
