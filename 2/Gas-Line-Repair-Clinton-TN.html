Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no way to offer one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.

Recharging far too late causes performance to fall off.</p>
