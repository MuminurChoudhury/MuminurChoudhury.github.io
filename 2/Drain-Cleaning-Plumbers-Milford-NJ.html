<p>Gas leaks happen for numerous factors. Typically, you might experience gas leakages if you have an older home. In older houses, aged gas lines can erode and wear out, permitting gas to permeate through the pipes. Consumer satisfaction is of utmost importance to A-1 Sewer & Drain Plumbing & Water Heaters, which is why we aim at getting your malfunctioning equipment fixed as quickly as possible, typically at the very first effort. Nothing is more important to them than their customers, and their satisfaction.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
