<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions ensure the security, security and consistent performance of research, vacuum, and commercial process systems. If pushing down on the flapper stops the noise, the flapper isn't sealing under regular pressure. Turn off the water, flush the toilet to clear the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. Clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad if you feel mineral deposits. Don't utilize anything that may roughen it. You need to replace the flapper if cleaning the flush valve seat doesn't fix the problem.</p>
