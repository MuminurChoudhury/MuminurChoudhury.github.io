<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this might be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component.

To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
