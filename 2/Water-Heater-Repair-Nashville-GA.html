Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
<p>Lubrication may help with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly.

The usual use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly lubricated to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of excessive lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out faster by bring in dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the element. The correct quantity of lubricant should make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You should never see pieces or globs of lube.</p>

Knowing the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
