<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
