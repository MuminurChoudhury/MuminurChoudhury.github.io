<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up over time, they slowly begin to constrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to occur, so by the time you see it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be checked yearly. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated every year to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
