<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and solidify or just be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
