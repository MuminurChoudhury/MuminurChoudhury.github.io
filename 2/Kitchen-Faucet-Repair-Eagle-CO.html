<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Eagle CO</h3>
<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride may be suitable if health or environmental reasons necessitate limiting salt. Gradually, the beads end up being coated with minerals and need to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: rinse, recharge and backwash. The regeneration procedure can be set up automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>

Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Generally, the cost savings have been based mainly on minimizing chemical and cleaning agent costs. While those cost savings are still significant, new commercial softening innovation using multi-tank systems (MTS) also offers considerable water and salt cost savings.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the problem if this is the case. You might need to look into using a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
