<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it right away becomes a serious safety hazard. Without being fixed as quickly as possible, it could trigger a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside becomes ignited. If an individual realizes that they have burst a gas line, the first top priority is to turn off the supply of natural gas and call the energy company.
