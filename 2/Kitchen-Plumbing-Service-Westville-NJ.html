Double flush valves are becoming more and more common, as both manufacturers and customers look for new methods to conserve water. Double flush toilets permit the user to pick the level of water needed to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is strong or liquid. We've all heard the old expression, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, many people find that squicky - and so the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just using less water to do it.</p>
<p>Include an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting spring-loaded, air inlet valve. We'll show you three common gas piping circumstances.
