<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
