<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Just like numerous things sewer lines can stop working just since of aging. After several years of being underground and baring the components sewer lines can get worn and damaged.
