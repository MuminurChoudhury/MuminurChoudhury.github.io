<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow, occurs. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
