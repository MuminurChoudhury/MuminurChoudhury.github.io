<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Again, it is advisable to check the maker's directions for special precautions.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
