<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Thornville OH</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>If your home is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000.
