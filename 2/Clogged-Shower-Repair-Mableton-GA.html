<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
