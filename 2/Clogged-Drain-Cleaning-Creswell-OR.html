<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
