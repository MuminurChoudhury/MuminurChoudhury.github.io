Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin areas leak right away and sometimes those leaks come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
