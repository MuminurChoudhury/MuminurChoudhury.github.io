<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve.
