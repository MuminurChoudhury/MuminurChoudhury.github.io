<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
