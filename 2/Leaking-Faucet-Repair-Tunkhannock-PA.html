<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
