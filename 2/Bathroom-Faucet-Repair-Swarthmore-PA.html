<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in lots of areas have greatly decreased the variety of reported incidents that occur within our water systems. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never truly have actually been a concern in the very first place. This thinking can be both counterproductive and harmful. Backflow occurrences in water supply are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a minimized pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or nothing method to backflow protection. We need to look at each installation for the risk it presents and after that install the appropriate security.</p>
