<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Vassar MI</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the safe and clean water system and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An approved, properly installed and maintained backflow assembly basically eliminates the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity. Still, the distinction is not enough to make any significant modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
