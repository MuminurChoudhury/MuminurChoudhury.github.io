<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any leftover impurities.</p>

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
