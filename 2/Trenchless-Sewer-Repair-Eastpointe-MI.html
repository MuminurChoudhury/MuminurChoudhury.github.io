<p>Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is completely odorless. The egg odor related to natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you need to take to safeguard yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
