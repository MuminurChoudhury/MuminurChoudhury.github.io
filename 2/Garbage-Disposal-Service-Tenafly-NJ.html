<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested yearly to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
