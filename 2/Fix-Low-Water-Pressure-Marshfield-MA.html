The problem with any leak or drip with a faucet is determining the root source. Often the leak or drip will be caused by a damaged faucet, worn out washers or seals, corroded -rings and gaskets, or elements that are just too old and need to be replacement.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they gradually start to restrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure.

Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
