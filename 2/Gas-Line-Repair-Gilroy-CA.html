Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
