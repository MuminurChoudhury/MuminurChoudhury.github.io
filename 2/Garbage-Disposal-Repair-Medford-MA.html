<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Medford MA</h3>
<p>Natural Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is totally odor-free. The egg smell connected with gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you must take to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
