<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally restore after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
