<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>

Backflow Preventer definition: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction.</p>
