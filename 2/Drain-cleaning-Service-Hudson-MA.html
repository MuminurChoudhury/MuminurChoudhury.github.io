These systems typically are installed in big, open areas within structures, and in multistory buildings for the purpose of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these buildings making it capable for a single person or firefighter to use a fast and effective  response to fire. There are 2 kinds of standpipe systems, the first type, are dry systems, which typically include no irreversible supply of water and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire personnel responding to an incident. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention protection. The second type is a wet standpipe system which is normally linked to the structures potable water supply and needs the installation of a double check valve assembly.</p>

If so, find the reset turn on the bottom of the unit. Use any type of drain cleaner to release it if the clog persists.</p>
