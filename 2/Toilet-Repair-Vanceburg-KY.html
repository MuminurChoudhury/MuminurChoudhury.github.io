A small cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the brand-new line during installation.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Examine the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
