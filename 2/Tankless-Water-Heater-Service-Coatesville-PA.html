It may be due to a corroded hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house if this happens just when your hot water is running.</p>

Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement.

Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
