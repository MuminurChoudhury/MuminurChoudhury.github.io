Subsequently residential permits released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated annually. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the irrigation system.
