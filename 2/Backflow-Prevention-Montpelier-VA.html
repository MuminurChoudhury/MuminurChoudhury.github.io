<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
