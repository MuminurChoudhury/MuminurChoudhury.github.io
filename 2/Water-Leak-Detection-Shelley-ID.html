Huge Blue Plumbing can manage the authorization and purchase process. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be tested periodically to ensure they are operating appropriately. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with properly adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
