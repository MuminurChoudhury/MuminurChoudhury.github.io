Subsequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested yearly. Also allows released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test.
