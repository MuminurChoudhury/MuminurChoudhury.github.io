<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
