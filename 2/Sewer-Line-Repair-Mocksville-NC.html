A fouled # 2 Examine Valve allows the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release up until the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>When a plumbing authorization has been provided in error because of inaccurate, inaccurate or insufficient info, or the work for which the permit was released breaks the Uniform Code, such permit will be withdrawed or suspended up until such time as the permit holder demonstrates that all work completed and all work proposed shall be in compliance with suitable provisions of the code.
