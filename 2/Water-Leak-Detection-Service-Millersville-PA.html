Temporary water will be enabled after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker must be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be firmly attached to strong rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is considerably complete is restricted unless a check backflow assembly is set up and instantly tested to ensure it is working.</p>
