<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
