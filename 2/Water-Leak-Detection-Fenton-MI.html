It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk.

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
