<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
