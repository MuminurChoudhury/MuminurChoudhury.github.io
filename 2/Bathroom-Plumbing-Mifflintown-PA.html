An approved, correctly set up and preserved backflow assembly basically gets rid of the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any substantial modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Obstructions are quickly avoided with a couple of key steps. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers catch hair, food and other particles before it gets stuck, avoiding the need of drain cleaning. Although they do not capture whatever, it assists the system substantially.
