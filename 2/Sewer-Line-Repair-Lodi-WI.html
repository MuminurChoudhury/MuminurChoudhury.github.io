<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles however will squander more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not.

<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal.
