<h3>When To Call A Plumber Seaford NY</h3>
<p>For the purpose of water treatment, hardness is determined in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is defined as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To convert between gpg and ppm use the list below factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm. Additionally, milligrams per litre is equivalent to parts per million and can be utilized synonymously.</p>
<p>The other difference in between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals only squash the food in batches (thus the name)-- not at one time like a continuous feed garbage disposal.
