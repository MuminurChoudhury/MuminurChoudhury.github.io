Your water heater is dead when the tank leaks. The dead giveaway that your water heater requires replacing is a slow drip beneath, normally appearing as a trail of rusty water. This suggests that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be fixed. Other symptoms, such as inadequate or no warm water, generally signal other hot water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.
