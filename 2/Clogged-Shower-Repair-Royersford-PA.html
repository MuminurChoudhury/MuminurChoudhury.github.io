About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used throughout the backflush operation. What we indicate is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work just great, but if your toilet is really old (and obsoleted in design), you may want to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

Plus, a brand-new toilet could make your bathroom remodel sizzle.</p>
