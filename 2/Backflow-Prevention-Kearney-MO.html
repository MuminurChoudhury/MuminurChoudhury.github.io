When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
<p>The term tough water describes water with a high mineral material. These minerals can differ depending on which area of the country you're in, but many typically include calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates.
