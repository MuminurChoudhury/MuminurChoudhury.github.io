<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close.
