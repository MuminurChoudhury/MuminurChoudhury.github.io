<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Bishop CA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
