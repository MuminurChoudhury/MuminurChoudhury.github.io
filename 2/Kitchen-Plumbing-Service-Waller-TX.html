As it gets worn, it can begin to break and solidify or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever is in great shape.</p>
