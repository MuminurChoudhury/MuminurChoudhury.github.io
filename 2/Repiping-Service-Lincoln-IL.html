<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
