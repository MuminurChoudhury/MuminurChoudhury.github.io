No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't do the trick then utilize Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to read the directions and security warnings first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's readily offered at a lot of hardware shops.</p>
