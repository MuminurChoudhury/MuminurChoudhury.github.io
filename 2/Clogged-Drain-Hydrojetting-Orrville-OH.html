<p>Dual Check Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Check Valve or double backflow prevention valve is essentially a disrobed Double Check Valve without shut off valves and test dicks. They are non-testable and are normally used by public utility and set up after a water meter to prevent the meter from running backwards and low protection versus backflow. This tool is the center of debate with lots of backflow authorities and must never be puzzled with Check Valves. Check with local authorities for required installation, as many do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention devices.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers need to only be fixed when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually degraded in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
