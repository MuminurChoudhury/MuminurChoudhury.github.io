As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and split or just be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
