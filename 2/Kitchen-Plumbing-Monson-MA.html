<p>Slow drains. A slow drain can be a typical plumbing issue, and most blockages can be resolved with a simple fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The problem can be a much deeper obstruction somewhere in the main sewer line if the simple unclogging methods don't work to solve the sluggish drain. Regrettably, mainline blockages are usually much bigger obstructions than need more than easy unclogging techniques, however digging into the line itself to access the source of the issue.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made from copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
