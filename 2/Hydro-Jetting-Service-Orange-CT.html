They are not intended to have continuous pressure on the downstream side and can not be utilized as a master valve.</p>
<p>All faucets and valves in your house ought to be frequently worked out to keep them from freezing in place.

If you can't locate this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom handle or plunger into the sink drain opening and try to rotate the jammed flywheel. If it appears to be moving easily turn the system back on (and do not forget to turn back on the breaker if you do not it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
