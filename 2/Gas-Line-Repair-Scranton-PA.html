<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
