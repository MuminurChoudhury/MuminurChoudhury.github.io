<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never precisely matches supply.
