Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
