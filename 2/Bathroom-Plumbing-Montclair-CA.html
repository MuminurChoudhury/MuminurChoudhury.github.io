<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
