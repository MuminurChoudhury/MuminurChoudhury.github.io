<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
