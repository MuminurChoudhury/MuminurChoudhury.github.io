<p>Lubrication might help with the placement of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any better, it is just there to help the professional assemble the parts into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lubricant to assure the water supply is not polluted. In most cases the very best lubricant is water. The typical usage for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or use out quicker by drawing in dirt and debris or limiting the movement of the element.

<p>The check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire defense market, creating a redundancy designed to guarantee that a person check valve will continue to protect the city water system even if the other fails.

Test cocks, or small ball valves, enable the attachment of testing devices that assesses whether the check assembly is practical.</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is.

A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
