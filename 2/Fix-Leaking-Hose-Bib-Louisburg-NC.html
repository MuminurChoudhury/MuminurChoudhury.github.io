<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a typical plumbing concern, and many obstructions can be solved with a simple fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The problem can be a much deeper obstruction somewhere in the main sewer line if the basic unclogging approaches do not work to resolve the slow drain. Sadly, mainline blockages are usually much larger blockages than require more than basic unclogging techniques, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the issue.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect over time, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you discover it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
