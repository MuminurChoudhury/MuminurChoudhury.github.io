<p>Sometimes, leakages can be sealed by welding or comparable approaches. However, if leaks keep springing up in the exact same length of pipe, then it's very likely that you're dealing with a flaw in the pipe, which needs to be replaced. A leak is only a matter of time if you observe corrosion or rust on a pipe.

This process continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
