See how the plumber does on this smaller task.</p>

This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we reveal, inspect the instructions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
