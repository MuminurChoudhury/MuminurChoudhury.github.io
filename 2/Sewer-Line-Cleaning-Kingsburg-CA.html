<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). Check the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal.
