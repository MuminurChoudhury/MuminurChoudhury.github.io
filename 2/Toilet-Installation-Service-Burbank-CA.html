<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.
