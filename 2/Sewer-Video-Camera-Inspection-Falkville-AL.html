<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
