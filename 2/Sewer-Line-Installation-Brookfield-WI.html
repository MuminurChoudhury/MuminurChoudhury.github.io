<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>
