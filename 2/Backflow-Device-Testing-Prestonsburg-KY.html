<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

<p>Our process begins with an inspection of the different problems faced by the property owner, this is followed by among our substantial team of professionals placing a camera into the drains to identify the blocked area and determine how best to proceed.
