<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid normally will help remove them. If you wish to attempt the gentlest approach perhaps try using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't do the trick then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and safety warnings first!).

<p>The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September.
