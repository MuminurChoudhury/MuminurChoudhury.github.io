An approved, properly installed and preserved backflow assembly basically removes the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage.

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
