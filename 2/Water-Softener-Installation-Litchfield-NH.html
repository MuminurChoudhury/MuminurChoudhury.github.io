<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested each year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested annually to guarantee the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
