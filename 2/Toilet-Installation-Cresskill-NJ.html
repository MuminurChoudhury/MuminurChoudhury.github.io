<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
