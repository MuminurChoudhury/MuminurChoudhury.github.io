A clogged drain can even result in slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>
<p>After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water home appliances?
