Also, toilets use up such a big part of your bathroom that lots of people are beginning to take them into account when upgrading their bathroom style choices. But that does not imply toilets are ideal-- in time they will need to be fixed when something fails, and they may even eventually need to be replaced. Whether you're wanting to install a new toilet or fix up the one you have so it works like new again, you can depend upon the Sterling plumbers from Donmar Heating, Cooling & Plumbing to get the job done.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Inspect the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
