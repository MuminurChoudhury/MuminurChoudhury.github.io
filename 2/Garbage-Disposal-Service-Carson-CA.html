<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to get away.

<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
