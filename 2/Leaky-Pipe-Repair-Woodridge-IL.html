<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
