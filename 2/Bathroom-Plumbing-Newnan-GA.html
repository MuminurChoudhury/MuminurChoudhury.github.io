Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
