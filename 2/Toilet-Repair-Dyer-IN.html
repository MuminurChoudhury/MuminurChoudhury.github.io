<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Dyer IN</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
