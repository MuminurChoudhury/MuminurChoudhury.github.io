However, it adds a fair amount of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly little round device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
