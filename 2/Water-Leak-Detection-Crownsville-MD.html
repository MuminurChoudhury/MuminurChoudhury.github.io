<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
