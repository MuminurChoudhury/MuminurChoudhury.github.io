<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is specifically susceptible to repeating pinhole leaks (deterioration that breaks through the surface of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish corrosion on copper piping. Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit include this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't break as fast. All leaks, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be fixed.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
