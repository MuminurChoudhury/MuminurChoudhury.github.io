When it concerns the concern of tough water, a conventional water softener in fact gets rid of magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is known as short-lived firmness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

Something to understand about gas lines is they can be incredibly dangerous if there is a leak. While gas leaks are unusual, you need to leave the building immediately if you see an odor like rotten eggs in your property. A gas leak can have almost instant effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. If you have actually got a gas pipe leaking, get out of your home and call us immediately.</p>
