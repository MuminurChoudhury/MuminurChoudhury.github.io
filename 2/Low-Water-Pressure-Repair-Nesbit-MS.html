Commercial assemblies must be tested every year.

<p>The cost depends on the size of the home and the variety of bathrooms and plumbing components-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your final costs.

For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl.
