<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically utilize an element that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is instantly switched off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature level is normally pre-set to match your choices and requirements. Since they just heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than standard water heaters.</p>
