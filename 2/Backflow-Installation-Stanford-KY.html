Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
