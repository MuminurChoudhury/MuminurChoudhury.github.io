To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to consider repiping your entire house when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
