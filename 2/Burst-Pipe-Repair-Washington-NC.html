<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
