<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to escape.
