<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with.
