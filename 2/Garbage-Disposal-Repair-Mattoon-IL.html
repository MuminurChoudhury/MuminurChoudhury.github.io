<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

After all, excessive pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water home appliances.</p>

We advise installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to inform you of any potential gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
