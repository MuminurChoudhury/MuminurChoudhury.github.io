<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the technique set out above. Since the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
