<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite instructions from its normal circulation. IRWD's potable water system is developed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "typical," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water entering the potable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic material, which means germs will not grow on it. Copper has actually been utilized (along with PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures.

<p>If you spot a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping job, just remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same material and they may be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your entire home when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
