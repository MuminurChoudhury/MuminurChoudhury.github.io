New meters should meet policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas suppliers may require an unique meter for their services, restricting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the structure authorization. Inspections must be made after foundation excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If faulty work is discovered, the inspector will provide a violation notice, and a specific time period is allotted to fix the problem.</p>
<p>In community supply of water systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or service. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario takes place, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach used.

If an air space is not possible, then the appropriate backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
