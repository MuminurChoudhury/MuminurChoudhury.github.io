For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>

The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow.
