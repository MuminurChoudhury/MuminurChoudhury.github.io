For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
<p>When the data collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers must just be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
