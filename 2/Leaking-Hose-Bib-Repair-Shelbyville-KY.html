<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>Numerous house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their dirty or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to utilize and economical, however they damage your pipes and their results are only short-term.
