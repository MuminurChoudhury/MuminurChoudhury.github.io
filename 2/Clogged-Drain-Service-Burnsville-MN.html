An approved, appropriately set up and preserved backflow assembly basically gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the distinction is insufficient to make any considerable modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Lubrication may help with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly.
