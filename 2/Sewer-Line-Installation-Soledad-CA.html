Avoid tough water from damaging your toilet and bathroom plumbing. Initially call your local utility company then call a plumber if you believe a gas leak. Licensed professional plumbers will discover and repair the gas leak, provide licenses, and collaborate with the city for last inspections. An energy company will identify if there is a gas leak, but they do not find the source of the leak or repair it.</p>
