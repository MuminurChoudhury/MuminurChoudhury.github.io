If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
