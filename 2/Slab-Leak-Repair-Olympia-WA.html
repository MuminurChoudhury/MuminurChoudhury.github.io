<p>Irrigation backflow gadgets are designed for installation on potable water lines to secure against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the drinkable water supply. While there's not a specific timetable as to when you must repipe your home, you should certainly check out repiping if they have not been carried out in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain exactly what was incorrect with the system, how he fixed the issue, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly advise Hunter for any problems you may have.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention test kits and repair parts are a must for the devoted do-it-yourselfer. Our backflow test sets are compatible with all decreased pressure concept, check valve, spill resistant, and pressure vacuum breaker type backflow preventers. All our kits are portable and compact, and feature the needed gauges, tubes, and adapter fittings. Note: The Planning & Advancement Department can not release a list of authorized backflow prevention assemblies, which is offered to USC members just. However, for information on noted approved backflow assemblies, contact Backflow Prevention at 602-534-2140.</p>

Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners since they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it.
