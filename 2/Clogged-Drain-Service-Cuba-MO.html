<p>Trees and shrubs are a common cause of sewer blockages to the house. Roots can grow into the tiniest crack or space in your home's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient rich environment supplied by the sewer. Flat roofs typically have drains spaced out around their boundary.

These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal since they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
