<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An approved, appropriately installed and kept backflow assembly basically gets rid of the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any substantial modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring.
