<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked yearly. Also allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated each year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
