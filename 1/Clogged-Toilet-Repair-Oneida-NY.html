The outdoor gas meter need to be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). Check the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
