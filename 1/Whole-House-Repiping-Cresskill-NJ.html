<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee. This is specifically real when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
