<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Bellport NY</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
