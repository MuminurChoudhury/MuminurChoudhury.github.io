The test period will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall stand up to the test pressure defined without revealing any proof of leakage or other problems. Mechanical evaluates utilized to measure test pressures shall have a variety such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than 5 times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed using a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure required for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as suggested by pressure determines during inspection will be deemed to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>
