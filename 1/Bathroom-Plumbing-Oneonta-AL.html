<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
