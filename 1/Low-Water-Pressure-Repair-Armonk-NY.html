<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>An air pressure test is needed. The test pressure shall be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test duration shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall endure the test pressure defined without revealing any proof of leak or other flaws. Mechanical gauges utilized to measure test pressures shall have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be performed using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as shown by pressure gauges during inspection shall be considered to indicate the existence of a leak.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
