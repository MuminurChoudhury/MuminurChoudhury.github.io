<h3>Leaky Faucets at Adairsville GA - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
