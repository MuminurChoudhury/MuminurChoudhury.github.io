The lubricant should be a food grade lubricant to assure the water system is not polluted. In a lot of cases the very best lube is water. The normal usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
