<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Corbin KY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
