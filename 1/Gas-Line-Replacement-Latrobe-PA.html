<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Because I love to cook, I produce a whole lot of meals. We set up a momentary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will remain clog-free for thirty days. If it obstructs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly use this company once again and again in the future.</p>
