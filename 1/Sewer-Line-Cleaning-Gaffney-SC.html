<p>The majority of toilets utilized today operate with a standard gravity flushing design, suggesting they use the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewage system. Recently, nevertheless, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in increasingly more houses.

A disadvantage of this device is that it's much more hard to unblock your toilet were to end up being clogged.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To prevent this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

You may have to look into using a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
