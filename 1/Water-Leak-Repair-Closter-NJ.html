A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release until the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
