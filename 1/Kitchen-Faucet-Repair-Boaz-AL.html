<p>Our team can help you with your hot water heater needs too. If you need to repair your water heater or replace it, allow our team to do the work for you. We ensure the work is done correctly every time. Physical Damage: Water tank and hot water heater repair from physical damage such as leakages or cracks are also common occurrences. If you observe low water pressure or stained water, it usually represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop in time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
<p>A reduction in supply side pressure triggered by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the customer side pressure.

Water will release up until the supply side pressure again exceeds the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
