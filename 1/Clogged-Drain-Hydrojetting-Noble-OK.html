<p>Does your home need a water conditioner? 2 Sons Plumbing can help. Call us for the installation of water softener and water filtration systems.

There's an excellent chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

The average cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 nationwide, depending upon the size and design. They are more secure to use than continuous feed disposals, but are not recommended for households that create a lot of food waste.
