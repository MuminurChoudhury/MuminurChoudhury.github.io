Garbage disposal guarantees last approximately 5 years, however they can range in between 2 and 10 years. Given that the typical lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might want to buy a prolonged warranty. Most warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures.
