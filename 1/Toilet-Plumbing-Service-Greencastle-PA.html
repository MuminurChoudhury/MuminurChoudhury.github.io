<p>Backflow preventers need to just be fixed when the information gathered from the field test shows the assembly has actually deteriorated in its performance listed below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
