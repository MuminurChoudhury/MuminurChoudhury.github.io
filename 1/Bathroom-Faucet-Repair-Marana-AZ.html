<p>For the function of water treatment, firmness is determined in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one United States gallon (3.785 l) of water.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
