Grains per gallon is defined as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) liquified in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
