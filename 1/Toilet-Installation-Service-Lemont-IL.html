<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly.
