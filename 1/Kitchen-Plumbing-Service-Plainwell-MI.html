<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to offer years of defense. There are numerous local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature can all cause the assembly to degrade in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
