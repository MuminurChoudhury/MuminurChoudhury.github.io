<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to eliminate hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure called Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC).

Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And because these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of caught ions.</p>

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well kept to assist avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl.

Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in great shape.</p>
