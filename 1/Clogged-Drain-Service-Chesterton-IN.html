<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
