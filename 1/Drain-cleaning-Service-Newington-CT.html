<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
