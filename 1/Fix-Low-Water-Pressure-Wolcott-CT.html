<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Wolcott CT</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater. To make sure that we are supplying high-quality work and consumer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely carry out hot water heater replacements. In addition to conventional hot water heater, we likewise install tankless hot water heater, and heat pump water heaters.</p>

This concern is typically caused by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as simple as a worn flapper valve. A drip pan is efficient and economical. The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into a suitable drain. An ideal time to install a drip or replace pan is when the water heater is being replaced.</p>
