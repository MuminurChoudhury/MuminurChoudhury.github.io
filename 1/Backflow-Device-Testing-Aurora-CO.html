<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
