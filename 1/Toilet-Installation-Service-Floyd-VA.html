<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to ruin micro-organisms and provide purified water. The energy source needed to warm the water is less expensive. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be eliminated relatively easily by utilizing an ion exchange procedure. Standard water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations refer to positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about completely regenerated.</p>
