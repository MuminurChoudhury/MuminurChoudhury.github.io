<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline.

Furthermore, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
