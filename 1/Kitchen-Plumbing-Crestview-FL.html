<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to obstructions that originate inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a various model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to consider.

<p>Roll plumber's putty between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and wrap it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening.
