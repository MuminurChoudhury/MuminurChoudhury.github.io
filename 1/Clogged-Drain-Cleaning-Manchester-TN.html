<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up with time, they slowly begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you see it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
