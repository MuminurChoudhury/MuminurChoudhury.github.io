If health or ecological reasons demand restricting sodium, substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride might be suitable. Over time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: recharge, backwash and rinse. The regrowth process can be set up immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
