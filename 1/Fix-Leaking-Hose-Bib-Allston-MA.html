<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I love to prepare, I create a lot of dishes. We set up a short-lived workaround at our guest bathroom sink, however after a day of this we understood that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for one month. If it blocks again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely happy that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly utilize this company again and again in the future.</p>
