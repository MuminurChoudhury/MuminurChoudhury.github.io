Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water in fact needs it. More recent units use digital sensors that keep track of bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just regrow when needed. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
