When you contact us to arrange your consultation, ask the length of time the inspection typically takes.</p>
<p>Align the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange underneath the sink. Press it into location, and loosely protect it by rotating the lower mounting ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper installing ring. Rotate disposer system as required to align drain assembly. There's a nasty smell coming from your drains - You might not see this right now, however nasty odors suggest whatever is stuck in your drains-- likely food waste-- is rotting in there. It's time to unclog if you can smell it.</p>
