<p>You might be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the very same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc finishing on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its job quite well, with time, it still does wear away. If you are currently experiencing clogged drains, we can assist! When several of your drains are clogged, water will typically start to back up into your sink, which can lead to odd smells.

<p>After eliminating standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water originating from your water home appliances? This is a good indication that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be replaced. Remember that if the rust-colored water just includes hot water, the cause could be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
