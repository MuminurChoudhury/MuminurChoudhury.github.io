Technical instruction includes safety, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and blueprint reading. Apprentices likewise study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. Most apprentices get in a program directly, however some start out as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
