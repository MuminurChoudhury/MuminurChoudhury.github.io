<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
<p>You need to schedule testing of your backflow preventer with a company from the County's certified testers The company will report your test results to us through the protected reporting website. Testing need to be finished within one month from the date of the letter. Dominion Services And Products, Inc., an affiliate of Rule Energy Inc., has partnered with HomeServe USA to offer clients optional house repair plans.
