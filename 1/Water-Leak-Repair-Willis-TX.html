An undamaged main sewer line must be airtight, implying no odors should get away the pipes. If you begin to smell something foul, however, that might imply a leak in the main sewer line. It's time to call a plumber if the aroma of rotten eggs and sewage begins leaking out of your drains.</p>
<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the approach laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior size of the tee. This is especially real when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
