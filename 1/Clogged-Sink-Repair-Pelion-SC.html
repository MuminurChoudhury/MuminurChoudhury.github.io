If it was developed before 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date material that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently).

For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and break or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
