<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>As water heaters age, specifically when they approach the decade mark, you might begin to notice some issues. Any types of unusual sounds usually recommend trouble. Popping sounds, for instance, show that the water is boiling (which should never ever take place). Sediment build-up or a defective thermostat represent typical factors for boiling water. Water naturally contains the minerals that can add to problems with a hot water heater, and areas with tough water may need more frequent flushes or service.</p>
