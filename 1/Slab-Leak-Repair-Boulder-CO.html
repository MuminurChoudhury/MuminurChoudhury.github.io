<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force.

That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
