If health or ecological factors necessitate restricting salt, substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride might be appropriate. Gradually, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regrowth process can be scheduled immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
