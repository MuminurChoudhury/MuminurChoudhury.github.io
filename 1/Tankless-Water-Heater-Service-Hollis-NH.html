Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to escape.
