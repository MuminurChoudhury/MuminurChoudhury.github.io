As soon as an individual ends up being a certified tester, there is a great chance the individual understands how to test a backflow preventer. Unfortunately, this does not mean the person knows how to repair a backflow preventer. Often times it is assumed if you can check them, you can repair them. This is not true. The repair specialist has a long list of things he must learn to be able to repair a backflow prevention assembly and return it to its initial factory specifications.</p>
<p>Harts has incredible customer care and reacted quickly to our plumbing emergency! Chris has actually been to our house in the past and is professional and really experienced.

Running water through it from the supply line will clear the particles. Images 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one common type of valve.
