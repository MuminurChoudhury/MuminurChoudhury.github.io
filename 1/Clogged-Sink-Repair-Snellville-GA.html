<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
