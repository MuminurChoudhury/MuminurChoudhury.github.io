<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, consider at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, changing exposed pipes in a utility, basement, or crawlspace  room is fairly straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>

<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge in between guy and machine.

And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making certain your trip lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those little day-to-day inconveniences - that the majority of people just deal with and never ever understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
