I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
