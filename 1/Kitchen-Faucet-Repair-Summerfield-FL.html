<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
