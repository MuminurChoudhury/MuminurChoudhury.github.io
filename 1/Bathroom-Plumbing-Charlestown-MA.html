<p>The next step for an ambitious plumbing contractor is to make a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing company and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors typically consist of paying an application fee and passing a detailed service, law and building regulations exam. Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Additional requirements for potential plumbing company owner might consist of proof of monetary reliability, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>
<p>Poorly installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job.

A clogged drain can even lead to sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>
