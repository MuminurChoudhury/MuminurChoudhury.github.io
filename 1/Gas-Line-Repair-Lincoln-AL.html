<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>
