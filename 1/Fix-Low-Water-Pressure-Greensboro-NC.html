<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
