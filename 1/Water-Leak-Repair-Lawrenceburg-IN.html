Our experienced specialists have the experience and skills to fix your plumbing problems, from drain cleaning to hot water heater repair and installation. Sediment buildup: This is among the most common causes of water heater problems. It can decrease hot water flow and cause tank rust. Oftentimes, sediment can be flushed out. We advise yearly flushing to keep your tank without abrasive aspects.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
