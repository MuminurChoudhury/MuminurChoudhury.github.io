The disposer unit is heavy and can be awkward to steer below the sink. Utilize a big bowl or other strong challenge prop up the unit as you position it. Water softeners generally have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively preserved. Ensuring the salt water tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the system.
