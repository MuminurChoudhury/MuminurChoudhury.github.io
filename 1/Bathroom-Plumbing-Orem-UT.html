<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
