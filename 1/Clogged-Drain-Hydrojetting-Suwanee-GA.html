If this occurs just when your hot water is running, it might be due to a rusty warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your home.</p>
<p>Those people in the market know that cross-connection programs in many areas have significantly decreased the number of reported occurrences that occur within our water systems. This has at times resulted in people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever really have actually been an issue in the very first place. This thinking can be both disadvantageous and hazardous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or nothing method to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it provides and then install the correct security.</p>
