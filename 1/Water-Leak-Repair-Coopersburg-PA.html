<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system should be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Hidden sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, little pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a larger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home. A great way to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Quickly and efficiently eliminating remaining potato peels, fruit skins and numerous other types of food waste, the disposal grinds it all into great particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into your house drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>
