The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater.
