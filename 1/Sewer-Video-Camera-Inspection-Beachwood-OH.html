<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Beachwood OH</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
