A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). Check the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
