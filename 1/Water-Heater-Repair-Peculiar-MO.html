<p>Slow drains. A sluggish drain can be a common plumbing concern, and many clogs can be resolved with a basic fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the basic unclogging techniques don't work to fix the sluggish drain, the issue can be a much deeper obstruction someplace in the main sewer line. Sadly, mainline obstructions are generally much larger blockages than need more than basic unclogging techniques, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Older homes with steel pipes are at risk of bursts and leaks. Call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and inquire about our whole house repipe services today. The bright side, though, is that most policies will cover any damage from rusty or failing pipes. But you may need to show that the damage happened from a leak that was accidental and unexpected".
