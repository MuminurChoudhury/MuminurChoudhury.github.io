<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>

As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
