<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>If you have a more recent system, a basic repair or changing individual parts might be all that's required to get your water heater working again. You might be lured to weld or spot a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to conserve cash. While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same material as other pipes in your house, implying that problem might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you peace of mind and prevent bigger leaks down the road.</p>
