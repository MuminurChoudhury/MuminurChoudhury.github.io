Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in a lot of houses and accounts for over 30 percent of overall household water intake. Toilets made prior to the 1980s might use up to 7 gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the job and still squandering water. Later designs from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>A clogged toilet can be one of the most aggravating problems in your home. Our Albuquerque plumbers can unclog your toilet and give you choices for preventing future problems. If your toilet is difficult to flush since you need to flush it several times, it might be the outcome of bad drain ventilation or a clog somewhere farther down the line.

For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to split and harden or just be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
