<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Elkin NC</h3>
<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, sink, or shower) can be corrected easily if the clog is easy and shallow. For many clogs you'll just need a plunger, and often some chemicals, however if this doesn't solve the problem then you might also need to contact a drain expert like Reckon & Reckon to assist. As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>If you identify a leak and select a patching job instead of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same material and they might be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your entire house when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
