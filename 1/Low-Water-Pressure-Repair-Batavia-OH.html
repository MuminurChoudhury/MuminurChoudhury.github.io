The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to leave. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
