If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you should require to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.
