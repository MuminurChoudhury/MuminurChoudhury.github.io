You must also reduce the tee that the discharge pipe connects to if the new unit's outlet is lower. Loosen up the two nuts that link the tee to the tailpiece above and the trap below. Attempt lowering the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. You'll have to replace it with one that's somewhat longer if it's not.</p>
<p>An air pressure test is needed. The test pressure will be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test period will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall stand up to the test pressure defined without showing any proof of leak or other problems. Mechanical determines utilized to determine test pressures shall have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure.

The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection.

<p>Since it is versatile and light-weight, plastic pipe is a widely used material. Its seamlessness makes it a good product for installation in unstable environments.

It will be better to cope with a brand-new, more effective unit than to spend on frequent repairs.</p>

Softening your thin down to the optimal level of 6 grains of solidity is ideal for household use since the water remains less corrosive than over-softened water and is free of scale producing firmness.
