<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the start of our home improvements. George and Anthony did a remarkable task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They likewise worked around our particular needs for our home. I will constantly use them and request for George particularly for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and offered very good pricing for what we needed done. I extremely recommend this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
