<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>To the end user (consumer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered items- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or bigger) will be devoid of any flaws in material and workmanship for a period of 10-years under normal application, service and usage. They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, however I give the company props for contacting us to update us on the later arrival time. Some jobs take longer than anticipated, that's easy to understand, by keeping us informed of the slight delay, we didn't have to worry.</p>
