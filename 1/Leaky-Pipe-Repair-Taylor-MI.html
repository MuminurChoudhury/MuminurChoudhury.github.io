Sewer video cameras can go numerous feet into the pipe, so they can be utilized to scope the main line.

You may need to look into using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
