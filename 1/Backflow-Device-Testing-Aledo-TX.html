<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
