<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly regrowed. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Tough water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>

Water will release up until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
