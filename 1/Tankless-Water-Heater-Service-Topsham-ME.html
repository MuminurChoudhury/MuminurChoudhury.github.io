<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
