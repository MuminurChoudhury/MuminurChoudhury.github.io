When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>

Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept free from harmful impurities.
