Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer utilized in new houses, however many houses developed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be gotten rid of by a professional plumber when found and replaced with another pipe product.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
