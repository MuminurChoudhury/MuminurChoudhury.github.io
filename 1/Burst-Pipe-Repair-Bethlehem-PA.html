<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are ending up being increasingly more common, as both makers and consumers seek brand-new ways to save water. Double flush toilets enable the user to choose the level of water required to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or strong.
