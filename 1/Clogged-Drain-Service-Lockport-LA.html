They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
