<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Tough water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms.</p>
