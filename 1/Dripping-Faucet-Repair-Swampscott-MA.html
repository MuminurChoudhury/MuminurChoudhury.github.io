The beads end up being complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly restored. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
