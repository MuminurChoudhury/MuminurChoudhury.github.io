<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems.
