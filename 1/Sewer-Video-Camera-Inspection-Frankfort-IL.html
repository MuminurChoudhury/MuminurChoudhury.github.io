<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
