<p>A license and inspections are needed for a lot of residential jobs including patios, additions, and equipment such as a/c unit and hot water heater. A strategy might be essential to get the license if brand-new work is carried out such as replacement of gas piping. Eventually, you'll need to rely on a relied on plumber to recommend you whether it's time for a pipe replacement. And it's always great to get a 2nd and even third  opinion before you embark on a replacement project. But there are a couple of methods you can mitigate the cost and trouble of the job.</p>
