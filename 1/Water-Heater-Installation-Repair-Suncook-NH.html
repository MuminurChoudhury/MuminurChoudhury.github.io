<h3>High Pressure Hydro-Jetting in Suncook New Hampshire</h2>
<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
