<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Ansonia CT</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure again surpasses the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
