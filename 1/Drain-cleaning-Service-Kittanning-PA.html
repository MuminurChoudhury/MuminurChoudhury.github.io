Age-- As we pointed out, a 10+ year old hot water heater is probably on its last legs. If you are not sure how old your system is, you must have the ability to get that information from the serial number on the manufacturer's sticker (usually near the top of the unit). Normally, the first two numbers show the year of your water heater.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has currently been fouled. Again, it is recommended to check the maker's directions for special precautions.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.
