<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver lady thought the cost she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things differently could have saved her a great deal of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
