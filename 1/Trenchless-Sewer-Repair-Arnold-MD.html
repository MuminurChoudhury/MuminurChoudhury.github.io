<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
