<p>The nationwide average cost to repair a leaking faucet is $65-$ 150, however the cost might be greater, depending upon the nature and reason for the leak. Typical water heater problems consist of tepid or cold water, a leaking tank or scalding water.

Sluggish drains: If you see that your drains are emptying slower, it might be a sign of the early stages of a clog.

Although other valves will look various, the clearing procedure is similar. However, you may have to eliminate a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to remove the cap.</p>
