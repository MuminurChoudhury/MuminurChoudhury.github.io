Even if the system is off, the blades are dangerous and sharp. Make sure the unit is off, you can even shut off the breaker to make sure it can't be switched on by accident. Your waste disposal unit comes with a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. Try to insert a broom manage or plunger into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench.
