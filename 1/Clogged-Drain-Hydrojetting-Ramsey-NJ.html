<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
