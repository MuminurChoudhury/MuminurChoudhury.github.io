<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and constant efficiency of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. The flapper isn't sealing under regular pressure if pushing down on the flapper stops the sound. Shut off the water, flush the toilet to clear the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. If you feel mineral deposits, clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad. Don't utilize anything that might roughen it. If cleaning the flush valve seat does not resolve the issue, you need to replace the flapper.</p>
