<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Chillicothe IL</h3>

Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in the majority of homes and represent over 30 percent of total household water usage. Toilets made before the 1980s may consume to 7 gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Lots of are still on the job and still squandering water. Later designs from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
