<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Campobello SC</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>If your home is over 50 years old, it's a great bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000.
