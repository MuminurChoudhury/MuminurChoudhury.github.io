<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
