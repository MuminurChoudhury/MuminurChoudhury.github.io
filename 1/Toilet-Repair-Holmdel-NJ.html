<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
<p>Although the technician concurred that the client did the ideal thing in her attempts to tighten up the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had actually become incredibly rusted throughout the years which a PVC pipe may be much better fit for the client's needs. He shut off the water supply to the home, removed the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its location. Before leaving the residence, the technician restored water flow and tested the pipe.</p>
