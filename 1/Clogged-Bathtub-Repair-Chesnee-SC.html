<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the start of our house improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our home. I will constantly use them and ask for George particularly for all future concerns or repairs. They were prompt and offered great rates for what we needed done. I highly advise this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
