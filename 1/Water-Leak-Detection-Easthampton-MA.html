<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested yearly to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your home. For further details or assistance please call the Cross Connection Control office at 301-206-4004.</p>

<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try in Easthampton MA</h3>
<p>Natural Gas and lp that comes out of the ground is totally odorless. The egg odor associated with natural gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you must require to protect yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
