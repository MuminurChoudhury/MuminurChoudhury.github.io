<p>A clogged pipe can also enable water to leak into a structure. This not only compromises the structural stability of a structure, but it can likewise let water in through the floorboards, triggering them to compromise and stain over time.

Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
