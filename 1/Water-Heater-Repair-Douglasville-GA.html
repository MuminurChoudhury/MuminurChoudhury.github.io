In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly.
