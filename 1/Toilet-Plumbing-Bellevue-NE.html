Longstanding Clogs: Blockages that continue after you've attempted to repair them require professional help. Continued attempts on your own can harm your lines, and you may have a more serious underlying issue than you are aware of. Additionally, the longer you delay to call for professional support, the greater the possibility that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
