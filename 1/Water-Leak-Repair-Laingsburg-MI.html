<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation.

That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
