<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You might have to check out using a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
