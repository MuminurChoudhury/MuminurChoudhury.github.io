<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<p>Reducing or eliminating water firmness is done with a tool referred to as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange procedure takes place. A softener is consisted of different parts, each having their own unique purpose. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel normally built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electrical timer that charges the system and flushes on a routine schedule.</p>
