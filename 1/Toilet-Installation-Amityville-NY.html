<p>A recently set up hot water heater should not produce odd sounds, but it will start to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat the water. Things get worse drastically for households with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy.
