<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Annandale NJ</h3>
<p>This is a completely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as important as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. However, it adds a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a relatively small round device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Changing a failed garbage disposer can appear difficult. There's the usual uneasiness about electrical energy and water, the unfamiliar sink connection and enough drain fittings to make leakages a real possibility. Then there are the hassles of comparison shopping and the suspicion that the task might encounter real money. And finally, stopped working disposers don't often leak, a minimum of not in the beginning, so it's simple to put things off.</p>
