<p>Leakages are sneaky. While the time required will vary based on your home size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to reserve approximately 2 hours when you schedule an inspection. There's constantly the opportunity that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a very little plumbing system). When you call to schedule your appointment, ask how long the inspection normally takes.</p>
