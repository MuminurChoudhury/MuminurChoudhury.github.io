<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
