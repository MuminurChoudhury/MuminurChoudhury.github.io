Backflow can take place in a number of situations that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
