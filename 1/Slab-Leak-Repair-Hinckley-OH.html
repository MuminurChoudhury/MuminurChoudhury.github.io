<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is heated up, difficult water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
