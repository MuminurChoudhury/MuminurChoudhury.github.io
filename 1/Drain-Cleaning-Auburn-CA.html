<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
