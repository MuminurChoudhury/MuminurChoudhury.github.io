<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, basement, or energy  room is relatively simple, since the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

I am so impressed with this company. They responded to a hot water heater concern at my business within thirty minutes of me calling. I would advise Marin WATER for any plumbing problem.
