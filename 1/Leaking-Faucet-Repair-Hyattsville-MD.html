This, in turn, can not just result in the garbage disposal no longer operating efficiently or correctly, but can likewise lead to problems with other components and plumbing units.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
