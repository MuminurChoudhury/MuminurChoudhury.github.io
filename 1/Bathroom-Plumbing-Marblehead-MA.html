<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to get away. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
