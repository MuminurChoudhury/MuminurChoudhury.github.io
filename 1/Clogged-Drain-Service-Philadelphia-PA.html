<p>The waste disposal unit is humming, but not turning. The waste disposal unit has become jammed. IF IT IS JAMMED, NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL. Even if the unit is off, the blades are sharp and harmful. Make certain the unit is off, you can even shut off the breaker to make certain it can't be turned on by mishap. Your waste disposal unit comes with a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening situated at the bottom of the system. If you can't find this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom plunger or deal with into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel. If it seems to be moving easily turn the unit back on (and do not forget to turn back on the breaker if you do not it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
