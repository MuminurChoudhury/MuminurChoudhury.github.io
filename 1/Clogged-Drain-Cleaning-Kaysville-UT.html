<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best first experience with the beginning of our home enhancements. George and Anthony did an incredible task for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular needs for our home. I will always use them and request for George specifically for all future issues or repairs. They were prompt and offered excellent prices for what we required done. I extremely advise this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically make use of a component that heats up water when the tap is switched on.

Due to the fact that they only heat water when required, tankless electrical water heaters use less power than standard water heaters.</p>
