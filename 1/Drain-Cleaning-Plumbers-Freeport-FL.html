If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you ought to require to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
