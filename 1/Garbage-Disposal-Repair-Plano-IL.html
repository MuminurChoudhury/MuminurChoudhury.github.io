<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
