<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

Homes that use gas for heat or for other numerous appliances have a gas line that links straight to the heating system, hot water heater, stove, and other devices that use gas. The most common gas utilized for residential homes is natural gas. Utility companies provide this gas to homes through an underground pipe system.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should always run cold water while the garbage disposal is on to guarantee that food bits are totally pressed through. Warm water can trigger things like grease, oil, and starches to liquefy and pass through the disposal, but they will only strengthen further on down the drain, potentially leading to a clog.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
