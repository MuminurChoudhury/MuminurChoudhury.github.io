<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from normal flow direction within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being higher than the supply pressure. This decrease in supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe). Waste disposal unit service warranties last an average of 5 years, but they can vary between 2 and 10 years. Since the typical lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may want to purchase an extended warranty. The majority of warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid more breakdowns, homeowners should keep up with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>

Other great options are overload defense, which turns off the motor if it starts to get too hot; an auto-reverse function to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the filthy meals get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly created to be utilized with a septic tank. gives a summary 1 of waste disposal unit and septic tanks.</p>
