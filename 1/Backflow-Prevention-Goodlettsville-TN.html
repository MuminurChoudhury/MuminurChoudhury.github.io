While there's not a precise timetable as to when you need to repipe your home, you need to definitely look into repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- particularly if you reside in an older home constructed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech discuss what exactly was wrong with the unit, how he repaired the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly recommend Hunter for any concerns you might have.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
