Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools supply contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Additional requirements for potential plumbing business owners might include proof of monetary reliability, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>

You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
