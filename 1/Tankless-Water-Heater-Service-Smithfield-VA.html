<p>As soon as the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
