While there's not a precise schedule as to when you should repipe your house, you must absolutely look into repiping if they have not been carried out in 50 years or more-- specifically if you reside in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain just what was wrong with the system, how he repaired the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly advise Hunter for any concerns you might have.</p>

<p>Are you sure it's safe for the types of pipes and fixtures in your home? The wrong type can harm or damage them. It may be essential to clean your kitchen drain's P-trap to clear the clog. The P-trap is at the curve of the drainpipe under the sink, generally inside a cabinet. Place a pan or bucket below the drain to capture any water or debris that might fall out. Unfasten the P-trap from the drain and clear out anything that is stuck. Then replace and run water through it.</p>
<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a common plumbing problem, and the majority of clogs can be resolved with a simple fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The problem can be a deeper clog someplace in the main sewer line if the basic unclogging techniques do not work to solve the slow drain. Sadly, mainline clogs are usually much larger blockages than need more than basic unclogging methods, however digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Examine the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However discovering the right washer may not be. The most common washers are typically readily available in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be difficult to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
