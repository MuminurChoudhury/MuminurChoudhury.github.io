<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Redmond OR</h3>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>A. We highly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from back or unfavorable pressure in your watering system at shutdown from going into back into your water source, therefore minimizing the threat of contamination of your water source. Many towns need using an authorized backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may wish to talk to your local municipality prior to installing your watering system.</p>
