This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever actually have been an issue in the very first location. This thinking can be both hazardous and counterproductive. Backflow events in water supply are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing method to backflow security. We need to look at each installation for the hazard it presents and after that install the appropriate protection.</p>
