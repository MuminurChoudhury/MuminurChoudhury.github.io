<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
