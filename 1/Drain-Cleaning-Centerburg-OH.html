Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
