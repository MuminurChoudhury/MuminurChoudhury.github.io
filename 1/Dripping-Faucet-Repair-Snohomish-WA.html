<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
