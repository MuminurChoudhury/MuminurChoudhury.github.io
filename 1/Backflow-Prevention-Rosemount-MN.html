<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Rosemount MN</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
