<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could take place.
